GameSpot is a modular, browser-based gaming platform built using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with backend support via MongoDB for user authentication. The platform features three classic games — Minesweeper, Whac A Mole, and Rock Paper Scissors — each designed to function independently while maintaining a consistent and responsive user interface.

Key features include:

Secure login system using MongoDB

Interactive and engaging gameplay

Basic scoring logic and game progression

A lightweight, framework-free architecture for learning and maintainability

The project showcases fundamental web development concepts such as recursion, randomization, DOM manipulation, and responsive design. While intentionally kept simple to focus on core skills, it provides a strong foundation for future expansion with features like leaderboards, multiplayer support, and mobile optimization.
